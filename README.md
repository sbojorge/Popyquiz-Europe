# Popy Quiz Europe

Popy Quiz Europe is an amusement, short quiz which purpose is to let the user to review/learn, in a fun way, interesting facts about some European countries.

The project was inspired from our family trip last summer: While we enjoyed discovering new countries we strove to teach our 7 years-old about them. Sometimes we found ourselves learning too.
Considering that, the content of the quiz and its design have been made to be accessible to general public from young children to grown-up of all ages.

With the intention of not discouraging our young public, it's been decided to have none score and not to disable the answers once the user has made a choice. The user can use then all his/her chances until discovering the right answer.

The website is responsive in the most common screen devices (smartphone, tablet, laptop and desktop) and within the following width categories:

* 320 x 480px
* 768 x 1024px
